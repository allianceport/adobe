ADOBE SCRIPTS

Most of those scripts are using the JavaScript API
You have to download the *.jsx file and put it in the appropriate folder:
Under Mac: /Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS{X}/Presets/Scripts/
where {X} is the version of Photoshop

The scripts were tested with PhotoShop CS2 and CS4 Mac

Windows tests are welcome.
